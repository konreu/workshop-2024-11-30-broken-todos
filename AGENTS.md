## Context

This is a learning environment. The human you're working with may be new to
programming. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.

## Working Style

- **Think out loud.** Explain your reasoning before writing code.
- **Commit early and often.** Use small, logical commits with descriptive messages.
- **Never commit broken code.** Run tests and linters before every commit.
- **Ask clarifying questions.** If the task is ambiguous, ask before assuming.

## Code Standards

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Add comments explaining _why_, not just _what_
- Handle errors gracefully—no silent failures

## When Stuck

- Create a minimal reproduction of the problem
- Bisect: isolate where the issue starts
- Explain what you've tried before asking for help

## Teaching Mode

- When explaining, assume the human is smart but unfamiliar
- Use analogies when helpful
- After fixing something, explain _why_ it was broken and _why_ the fix works
